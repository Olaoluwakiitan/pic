1. check out the repository or download the Pic folder from the github link
2. navigate to the Dockerfile in your location and run the Dockerfile via your choice IDE or through the CMD
3. After a successful run and build of the Dockerfile the port designated would be listed.
4. Click on the port to start interacting with the Pic Calendar event service.

A. Adding Calendar Events
i. this must be done using json format; example event entry is as follows -
{"description : "Test Completion",
"time": 2025-01-23 23:59:59,
"id": 1}

ii. The above should be entered into another terminal client terminal to the port provided by the Docker. and example entry (post) of event to the calendar is as follows -
requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:1000/events', json={"description : "Test Completion",
"time": 2025-01-23 23:59:59,
"id": 1})

B. Retrieving events by ID via call to the endpoint: /events/
  The example id search calls to the service is as follows-
requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:1000/events/', params={"ID" : 1})

C. Retrieving events within dates via call to the endpoint: /events
The example date search of events is as follows-
requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:1000/events',
params={"datetime_format" : "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S",
 "from_time": "2025-01-10 00:00:00", "to_time":2025-01-23 23:59:59})
